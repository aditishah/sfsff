      <h1>Night Market</h1>
      <p>La Cocina&rsquo;s first-ever San Francisco Street Food Festival will bring micro-entrepreneurs, informal food vendors, and renowned chefs together to celebrate and promote great street food, true entrepreneurial spirit, and the vibrant communities here in the Bay Area.  The San Francisco Night Market will be the kick-off for the festivities of all things street food.  It will be reminiscent of the nighttime markets in Bangkok or Singapore, with music, dancing, drinks, twinkling lights, and the enjoyment of many and varied flavors.   The food vendors will include local chefs of all stripes, and also guest chefs that will partner with La Cocina participants to create innovative, delicious dishes, available only at this event.</p>
      <p>It is a pre-ticketed event, serving as an important fundraiser for La Cocina, which is a 501(c)3 charitable organization.  For their donation of $25 to La Cocina, ticket holders will receive a ticket to the event and a gift bag, filled with all kinds of fun things.</p>
