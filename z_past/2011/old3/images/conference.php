      <h2>What</h2>
      <p>La Cocina&rsquo;s Food &amp; Entrepreneurship Conference 2012</p> 
      <h2>Where</h2>
      <p>San Francisco, Location TBD</p>
      <h2>When</h2>
      <p>August 19 &amp; 20, after La Cocinas San Francisco Street Food Festival</p>
      <h2>Why</h2>
      <p>The conference is a place where we can all come together—food enthusiasts and entrepreneurs, policy makers, nonprofit organizers and volunteers, city government officials, and media to discuss food, community, and entrepreneurship and to celebrate the ways that food creates opportunity.</p>
      <h2>Details</h2>
      <p>Themes that we will be discussing this year include promoting diversity and building community spaces through the shared experience of food; creating jobs and developing our economy in a sustainable, sound manner; supporting women and immigrant-run and owned businesses, and leveraging technology to do all of the above.</p>
      <p>We would never encourage going hungry—there will be food! A brunch Sunday and lunch on Monday, and ample opportunity to sample the delicious food that our participants whip up, both at the conference and at the festival! Tickets to the brunch and conference discussions will be made available here soon. Please check back for more information as the date draws closer.</p>
