<p><?= l('Think you know everything about food in San Francisco? Well, prove it. Over 3 weeks some of San Francisco&#x27;s best restauranteurs, most devoted food producers and hidden secrets of the city will band together to create a network of hidden foods. Street food is big, nowadays, but it&#x27;s always been around, so join this amazing community GoGame and get to know the streets of San Francisco from the city. Play in teams (easier to eat more food that way!) or on your own, but make sure you play. The game is organized in conjunction with La Cocina, an incubator kitchen in San Francisco&#x27;s Mission district that provides commercial kitchen space and technical assistance to low-income and immigrant women launching, growing and formalizing food businesses. This game will culminate in the Bay&#x27;s best day of eating at San Francisco&#x27;s first Street Food Festival.') ?></p>
